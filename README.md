# roeiboribor-portfolio-2021

This will be my fullstack portfolio using WAMP stack.

## Website theme

The theme of the website is using a darkmode & a neon lights for shadows of each section.
It inspires me to use gradient neon shadow effects to showcase the innovative looks of the website based on darkmode.

## Process / Methods

-   Helpers for me to loop into contents to avoid Don't Repeat Yourself **(DRY)**
-   Seperate each blades into reusable components
-   Used a vanilla JavaScript for dynamic changes of the elements

## Library/Framework used:

-   Laravel 8
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Animate.css cdn
