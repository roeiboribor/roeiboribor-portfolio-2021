# roeiboribor-portfolio-2021

This will be my fullstack portfolio using WAMP stack.

## Website theme

The theme of the website is using a darkmode & a neon lights for shadows of each section.
It inspires me to use gradient neon shadow effects to showcase the innovative looks of the website based on darkmode.
