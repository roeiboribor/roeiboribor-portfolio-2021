# roeiboribor-portfolio-2021

This will be my fullstack portfolio using WAMP stack.

## Website theme

The theme of the website is using a glassmorphism & a neon light for highlighter of each section.
It inspires me to use neon effects to showcase the innovative looks of the website based on darkmode.

## Process / Methods

-   Helpers for me to loop into contents to avoid Don't Repeat Yourself **(DRY)**
-   Seperate each blades into reusable components
-   Used a vanilla JavaScript for dynamic changes of the elements
-   SASS/SCSS for overrides of bootstrap variables & for easier use of CSS

## Library/Framework used:

-   Laravel 8
-   Bootstrap 5
-   Animate.css cdn
